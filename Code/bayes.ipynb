    "\n",
    "+ In many applications, there is prior information about unknown parameters. For instance, \n",
    "    - masses and energies are nonnegative and finite\n",
    "    - velocities do not exceed the speed of light\n",
    "    - a financial overcharge cannot exceed the entire charge\n",
    "    - vote-counting error that favored the winner cannot exceed the number of ballots\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Frequentist methods can use constraints directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Bayesian methods require augmenting the constraints with prior probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The difference between the frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints is that Bayesians\n",
    "_claim to know more about how the data are generated_:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Frequentists claim to know that the parameter $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, but not how $\\theta$ was selected from $\\Theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Bayesians claim to know that the parameter $\\theta$ was selected at random from $\\Theta$ according to a prior probability distribution $\\pi$ known to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Both claim to know $\\Pr_\\eta$, the probability distribution that the data would have if the value of $\\theta$ is $\\eta$, for each $\\eta \\in \\Theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In Bayesian analysis, the prior probability distribution captures the analyst's beliefs about the parameter before the data are collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The prior is updated using the data to construct the posterior distribution via Bayes' rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The posterior combines the analyst's prior beliefs with information from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - An analyst with different prior beliefs will in general arrive at a different posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To measure a probability in the Bayesian framework is to discover what the analyst thinks, while to measure a probability in the frequentist framework is to discover empirical regularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Because of the difference in interpretations of probability, the Bayesian framework allows probability statements to be made about a much larger range of phenomena. But the probability might be relevant only to the person performing the analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - For instance, mean squared error and posterior mean squared error are expectations of the same quantity, but with respect to different distributions:\n",
    "        + MSE is an expectation with respect to the distribution of the data, holding the parameter fixed\n",
    "        + PMSE is an expectation with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter, holding the data fixed.\n",

    "        + credible level is computed with respect to posterior distribution of the parameter, holding the data and the set fixed and allowing the parameter to vary randomly.\n",

    "    - If so, is its prior distribution known?\n",
    "    - Which is the more interesting question: what would happen if Nature generated a new value of the parameter and the data happened to remain the same, or what would happen for the same value of the parameter if the measurement were repeated?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Under some conditions, the largest Bayes risk as the prior is allowed to vary is equal to smallest maximum risk (the minimax risk) of any estimator as the parameter is allowed to vary.\n",
